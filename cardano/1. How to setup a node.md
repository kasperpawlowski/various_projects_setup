# Cardano node setup

The following installation steps were executed Ubuntu run via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Therefore, there's no guarantee that the steps executed on different operating system will succeed.

There are three crucial components of the Cardano node:
1. The node itself (cardano-node)
2. Command Line Interface (cardano-cli)
3. Wallet (cardano-wallet)

Prerequisites:
- the version control system git,
- the gcc C-compiler,
- C++ support for gcc,
- developer libraries for the arbitrary precision library gmp,
- developer libraries for the compression library zlib,
- developer libraries for systemd,
- developer libraries for ncurses,
- ncurses compatibility libraries,
- the Haskell build tool cabal,
- the GHC Haskell compiler (version 8.10.7 or above)

To install the above prerequisites execute the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install automake build-essential pkg-config libffi-dev libgmp-dev libssl-dev libtinfo-dev libsystemd-dev zlib1g-dev make g++ tmux git jq wget libncursesw5 libtool autoconf -y
```

Steps:
1. Installing GHC and Cabal
Execute the following command:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh
```
Respond to the installer prompts in the following manner:
```Do you want ghcup to automatically add the required PATH variable to "/home/ubuntu/.bashrc"?``` - (P and enter)

```Do you want to install haskell-language-server (HLS)?``` - (N and enter)

```Do you want to install stack?``` - (N and enter)

The installer will list the other prerequisites here. Not to have dependencies issues later on, it's good to try to install all of them. To do this, press ctrl-c to abort, copy the list presented on the screen and execute the follwing command:
```
sudo apt-get install /paste the dependencies list here/
```

Afterwards, run the curl command again and respond to the installer prompts in the same manner with pressing ENTER instead of ctrl-c.
```Press ENTER to proceed or ctrl-c to abort.``` (enter)

After successful installation, ghcup version should be returned after running the following command:
```
ghcup --version
```

Then, execute the following commands to install ghc and cabal:
```
ghcup install ghc 8.10.7
ghcup set ghc 8.10.7
ghcup install cabal 3.6.2.0
ghcup set cabal 3.6.2.0
```

After successful installation, ghc and cabal version should be returned after running the following commands:
```
ghc --version
```
```
cabal --version
```

2. Downloading and compiling the source code
Execute the following command to prepare the working directory:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/cardano-src
cd $HOME/cardano-src
```

Download and install libsodium:
```
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/libsodium
cd libsodium
git checkout 66f017f1
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Add the paths to the environment variables and reload the shell:
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH"
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

Download the cardano repository:
```
cd $HOME/cardano-src
git clone https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node.git
cd cardano-node
git fetch --all --recurse-submodules --tags
git checkout $(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/input-output-hk/cardano-node/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)
```

Configure the build options and build:
```
cabal configure --with-compiler=ghc-8.10.7
cabal build cardano-node cardano-cli
```

Install the newly built node and CLI commands to the $HOME/.local/bin directory. Add environment variable and reload the shell:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
cp -p "$(./scripts/bin-path.sh cardano-node)" $HOME/.local/bin/
cp -p "$(./scripts/bin-path.sh cardano-cli)" $HOME/.local/bin/
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin/:$PATH"
source $HOME/.bashrc
```

If successfull, the following commands should return cardano-cli and cardano-node versions:
```
cardano-cli --version
cardano-node --version
```
